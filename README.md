## What is the Learning Energy Profile?

Learning is an energetic system. Success depends not only on intelligence but on the match between person and study architecture. This tool analyzes your individual **Learning Energy Profile** across 6 evidence-based dimensions:

1. **Attention Architecture** – How robust is your focus?
2. **Sensory Processing** – How sensitive are you to stimuli?
3. **Social Energetics** – Do you learn better alone or in groups?
4. **Executive Functions** – How strong is your need for structure?
5. **Motivation Architecture** – What drives you?
6. **Autonomic Regulation** – How well do you manage stress?

**The goal:** Instead of generic "learning style" models, you get an individual profile showing how you learn optimally – based on stress physiology, attention research, and polyvagal theory.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dsci3d/learning-energy-profile.git
cd learning-energy-profile
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Complete the Questionnaire

The questionnaire (88 items, Likert scale 1-5) is available at:
- **Interactive web version:** (coming soon)
- CSV template in repo: `questionnaire_template.csv`

### 3. Calculate Your Profile

```bash
# Basic analysis (JSON + text report)
python auswertung_orchestrator.py --csv your_responses.csv --workflow basic

# Full analysis (including visualizations + HTML report)
python auswertung_orchestrator.py --csv your_responses.csv --workflow full
```

**Output:**
- `profil_[ID].json` – Your complete Learning Energy Profile
- `report_[ID].txt` – Text-based report with interpretations
- `report_[ID].html` – Interactive HTML report with charts (only with `--workflow full`)

## Workflows

The **orchestrator** provides 4 predefined workflows:

| Workflow | Description | Output |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `minimal` | JSON profile only | `profil_[ID].json` |
| `basic` | JSON + text report | + `report_[ID].txt` |
| `full` | Everything + visualizations | + `report_[ID].html` + charts |
| `validate` | System tests | Validation log |

**Example:**
```bash
python auswertung_orchestrator.py --csv questionnaire_answered.csv --workflow full --output-dir results/
```

## Scientific Foundation

The Learning Energy Profile is based on:
- **Stress physiology** (Allostatic Load, cortisol regulation)
- **Attention research** (Vigilance, cognitive capacity)
- **Polyvagal Theory** (Porges) – Autonomic regulation and safety signals
- **Motivation psychology** (Deci & Ryan: Self-Determination Theory)
- **Executive functions** (Working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility)

**Important distinction:** This is not a "learning styles" test (visual/auditory/kinesthetic), but an **energetic architecture model** of your learning conditions.

## Research Code Notice

⚠️ **This is research code, not production-ready software.**

- Developed for teaching and research purposes in higher education contexts
- Fully transparent and traceable (all calculation steps documented)
- Not a replacement for professional psychological diagnostics
- Validation ongoing in workshop contexts

**For production use:** Own validation recommended. Questions: kocmann@zedat.fu-berlin.de

## Workshop Integration

This tool is part of the **"Efficient Learning with AI"** workshop at Technische Universität Berlin.

**Complete workshop materials:**
https://publish.obsidian.md/dsci3d/Effzient+Lernen+mit+KI/1+Workshop+Übersicht

**Conceptual embedding:**
The Learning Energy Profile is the first step in a larger study architecture:
1. **Create profile** (this tool)
2. **AI duo as coach + reviewer** (workshop module)
3. **Obsidian + flashcards** as active learning surfaces
4. **Individual learning path configuration**
